# BuddyListApp
Buddylist Angular App
This is a simple app which displays a list of friends.
It fetches the list of friends by making an http call. 
Currently it is fetching data from local json files. But would just need a single line url change to fetch data from a backend resource.
It provides ability to delete and prioritize the Buddy.
It also provides more details of the selected buddy when clicked on it.
